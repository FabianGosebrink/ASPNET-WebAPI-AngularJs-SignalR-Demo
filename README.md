# AngularJsDemoAppWithSignalR
Application for AngularJS with SignalR included

As promised here is my Sample-Application. Note that this is just a sample! NEVER use a Singleton to replace a database in a business-application.

This was just made for demo purposes. AND it contains SignalR :-)

Regards & HTH
